# Hassle

A programming language and an interpreter based on Barry Jay's Tree Calculus

Inspirations:    
**Scheme** - for its syntax and homoiconicity    
**Haskell** - for its pure nature, lazy evaluation, currying, left-associativity, and IO handling    
**John Shutt's Kernel** - for uniting macros, special forms and functions    
**[Barry Jay's Tree Calculus](https://github.com/barry-jay-personal/tree-calculus)** - for its baked-in reflection capabilities    
**SICP chapter 4 footnote 33** - for the name of the language

It is still work in progress. A lot of things need to be figured out before it can be used as a language.
