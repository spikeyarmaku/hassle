# RealScript

An interpreter based on a modified Cactus Environment Machine

Inspirations:    
**Scheme** - for its syntax and homoiconicity    
**John Shutt's Kernel** - for uniting macros, special forms and functions    
**Haskell** - for its pure nature, lazy evaluation, currying, left-associativity, and IO handling    
**Cactus Environment Machine** - for its simplicity as an abstract machine and
for its spaghetti-stack environment model    
**SICP chapter 4 footnote 33** - for the name of the language
