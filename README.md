# RealScript

An interpreter based on the Cactus Environment Machine

Inspirations:
**Scheme** - for its syntax and homoiconicity
**John Shutt's Kernel** - for uniting macros, special forms and functions
**Haskell** - for its pure nature, lazy evaluation, currying, left-associativity, and IO handling
**Cactus Environment Machine** - for its simplicity as an abstract machine
